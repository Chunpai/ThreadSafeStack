    README                  - this file
    Makefile                - Makefile to compile all codes 
    serial.c                - serial implementation 
    parallel.c               - pthread implementation (lock free) of concurrent stack
    GetNumbers.c            - used to read the numbers stored in numbers.txt
    timing.c                - used to count the time
    timing.h                - header file
    stackHw.h                - header file
    
    numbers.txt              - where the input data stored

    serial.out               - binary code
    parallel.out             - binary code


Use commmands:
       make
                :- to compile and get the corresponding binary codes 
       
       ./serial.out N 
                :- N is number of iterations

       ./parallel.out N num_threads
                :- N is number of iterations
                :- num_threads is the number of threads

       make clean 
                :- clear all binary codes and matrices files which store in .csv
